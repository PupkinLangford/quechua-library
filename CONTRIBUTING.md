# Contributing

The idea is to make contributing to this project as easy as possible so that people of all skill levels can help out where and how they want to. A few things you can do to contribute are:

- Report an issue or bug
- Submit a fix
- Add to or update the documentation
- Translate the documentation and/or website into other languages
- Suggest new features
- Add content and/or styling to the website

## Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to add code and make other changes to the project.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make your changes and document them in your commit comment.
3. Submit your pull request

## Local Development

An easy way to see how your changes affect the website as you are coding on your local machine is to run the website files in a live server. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, it can easily be done using the [live server extension on Visual Studio Code][liveserver]. Once your changes are complete you can push your changes to your branch of the project and submit your pull request.

## Reporting Issues or Bugs

GitHub's issues feature is used to report and track issues or bugs, or to request a new feature. You can open a new issue [here][here].

**When reporting a bug:**
- Be specific: explain what you expect to happen vs what actually happens.
- Provide a screenshot or video of the bug if possible
- Include notes (why you think the bug might be happening or things you may have tried to fix it but didn't work).

**When requesting a new feature:**
- Include a summary of your idea.
- Explain what you would like added and why.
- Add any additional context.
